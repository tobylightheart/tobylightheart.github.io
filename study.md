I plan to experiment with using this website as a place to write and record study notes.
The plan is to survey, investigate and experiment with machine learning research.
This plan also includes experimenting with different methods of recording and structuring information.

Machine learning topics I'm interested in studying include:
- Constructive algorithms and constructive neural networks
    - Unsupervised, supervised and reinforcement learning
- Meta-learning and architecture search
- Autonomous learning agents and robotics

Experiments with past learning algorithms and novel ones I develop will go into a separate directory of pages.

I would also like to spend some time reviewing and studying other topics.
If things go well, I might make some pages reviewing topics of engineering, maths and science.
