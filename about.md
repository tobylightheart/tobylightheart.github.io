This is the research blog for Toby Lightheart.
I just recently submitted my PhD thesis on Constructive Spiking Neural Networks for Simulations of Neuroplasticity.
On this website I will be discussing technical and conceptual aspects of this research.
I am also planning to providing regular updates on a number of research projects in machine learning, focusing on algorithms that change the size of artificial neural networks.
I plan to make regular updates and have comments about the technology that I'm using and share work on GitHub ([github.com/tobylightheart](https://github.com/tobylightheart)).

I have another blog website ([tobylightheart.wordpress.com](https://tobylightheart.wordpress.com)) where I intend to discuss the development of learning guides for people and a range of philosophical topics.
