This is the research blog for Toby Lightheart.
I completed a PhD in Engineering at the University of Adelaide (Australia).
My PhD thesis is titled *Constructive Spiking Neural Networks for Simulations of Neuroplasticity*.
I plan to discuss technical and conceptual aspects of this research on this website.

I am also planning to providing (ir)regular updates on my research projects in machine learning, focusing on algorithms that change the size of artificial neural networks.
I plan to share code related to this work on GitHub: ([github.com/tobylightheart](https://github.com/tobylightheart)).

Posts may also comment on technologies and their use and implications.
I have another blog website ([tobylightheart.wordpress.com](https://tobylightheart.wordpress.com)) where I intend to discuss the development of learning techniques for people and a range of philosophical topics.
