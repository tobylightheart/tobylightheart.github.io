My name is Toby Lightheart.
I have created this website to communicate my machine learning research.

My primary machine learning research interest is continuous or life-long learning, i.e., machines that are capable of continuing to learn during operation. Some specific techniques that I am interested in exploring are:

- _Constructive algorithms_ to adapt the artificial neural networks size during operation to improve learning capabilities.
- _Selective networks_ to use neuron activity to select which neurons take part in inference and training. 

I completed a PhD in Engineering at the University of Adelaide in Australia.
My PhD thesis is titled *Constructive Spiking Neural Networks for Simulations of Neuroplasticity*.
See my [Research page]({{site.baseurl}}{% link research.md %}) for some research outputs and a link to my thesis and a detailed summary.

I'm currently employed as a Modelling and Simulation Engineering at Inovor Technologies.

Project updates on various technology projects (machine learning, robotics, data science, embedded software, etc) will be made in [Posts]({{site.baseurl}}{% link posts.md %}).

When work achieves sufficient maturity, it may be written up as a technical report or otherwise published and shared in [Research]({{site.baseurl}}{% link research.md %}).  
Writing and essays on technologies and their use and implications may also appear here.
I am planning to share code from these projects on GitHub: [https://github.com/tobylightheart](https://github.com/tobylightheart).

Literature surveys and reviews and notes from other study will appear in the [Study]({{site.baseurl}}{% link study.md %}) page. I am also experimenting with [TiddlyWiki](https://www.tiddlywiki.com) as a notebook for study and writing research notes: [my TiddlyWiki]({{site.baseurl}}tiddlywiki.html).

I have another blog website ([tobylightheart.wordpress.com](https://tobylightheart.wordpress.com)) where I intend to discuss the development of learning techniques for people and a range of philosophical topics.
