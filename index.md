<h1 class="post-title">This Website</h1>

My name is Toby Lightheart.
I have created this website to communicate my machine learning research.

I completed a PhD in Engineering at the University of Adelaide in Australia.
My PhD thesis is titled *Constructive Spiking Neural Networks for Simulations of Neuroplasticity*.
See my [Research](https://tobylightheart.github.io/research/) page for some research outputs and a detailed summary and a link to my full thesis: [https://tobylightheart.github.io/research/](https://tobylightheart.github.io/research/)
I'm currently employed as a Modelling and Simulation Engineering at Inovor Technologies, working on CubeSats.

My primary machine learning research interest is constructive algorithms, i.e., algorithms that increase the size of artificial neural networks during operation to improve learning capabilities.

Project updates on various technology projects (machine learning, robotics, data science, embedded software, etc) will be made in [Posts](https://tobylightheart.github.io/posts/): [https://tobylightheart.github.io/posts/](https://tobylightheart.github.io/posts/).

When work achieves sufficient maturity, it may be written up as a technical report or otherwise published and shared in [Research](https://tobylightheart.github.io/research/): [https://tobylightheart.github.io/research/](https://tobylightheart.github.io/research/).  
Writing and essays on technologies and their use and implications may also appear here.
I am planning to share code from these projects on GitHub: [https://github.com/tobylightheart](https://github.com/tobylightheart).

Literature surveys and reviews and notes from other study will appear in the [Study](https://tobylightheart.github.io/study/) page: [https://tobylightheart.github.io/study/](https://tobylightheart.github.io/study/).

I have another blog website ([tobylightheart.wordpress.com](https://tobylightheart.wordpress.com)) where I intend to discuss the development of learning techniques for people and a range of philosophical topics.
