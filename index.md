<h1 class="post-title">This Website</h1>

This is the research blog for Toby Lightheart.
I'm currently working independently on machine learning research: developing constructive algorithms which can increase the size of artificial neural networks during operation to improve learning capabilities.

I completed a PhD in Engineering at the University of Adelaide (Australia).
My PhD thesis is titled *Constructive Spiking Neural Networks for Simulations of Neuroplasticity*.
See my [Research](https://tobylightheart.github.io/research/) page for a link to a detailed summary and a link to my full thesis: https://tobylightheart.github.io/research/

Project updates on various technology projects (machine learning, robotics, data science, embedded software, etc) will be made in [Posts](https://tobylightheart.github.io/posts/): https://tobylightheart.github.io/posts/

I am planning to share code from these projects on GitHub: https://github.com/tobylightheart

Literature surveys and reviews and notes from other study will appear in the [Study](https://tobylightheart.github.io/study/) page: https://tobylightheart.github.io/study/

I have another blog website ([tobylightheart.wordpress.com](https://tobylightheart.wordpress.com)) where I intend to discuss the development of learning techniques for people and a range of philosophical topics.
This website may feature writing and essays on technologies and their use and implications.
