This is the research blog for Toby Lightheart.
I'm currently working independently on machine learning research: using "constructive" algorithms which can increase the size of artificial neural networks during operation to improve learning capabilities.

I completed a PhD in Engineering at the University of Adelaide (Australia).
My PhD thesis is titled *Constructive Spiking Neural Networks for Simulations of Neuroplasticity*.
See my [research page](tobylightheart.github.io/research) for a summary and a link.

I am planning to providing regular updates on my research projects and to share code related to this work on GitHub: ([github.com/tobylightheart](https://github.com/tobylightheart)).

I may also write on technologies and their use and implications.
I have another blog website ([tobylightheart.wordpress.com](https://tobylightheart.wordpress.com)) where I intend to discuss the development of learning techniques for people and a range of philosophical topics.
