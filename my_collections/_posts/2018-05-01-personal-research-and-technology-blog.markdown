I'll be using this website to discuss the research that I am doing in machine learning and computational neuroscience. 
Regular blog posts will provide updates on the progress on different projects and observations about the technologies that I am using. 
I am also planning on maintaining another blog website ([tobylightheart.wordpress.com](https://tobylightheart.wordpress.com)) dedicated to the development of learning guides for people and other philosophical ideas.

Today I've spent some time setting up Ruby on my current desktop computer to resume using this website.
I had some difficulties with updating the Gems installed in the system directory, so I've reinstalled Ruby using 'chruby' and 'ruby-install'.
In future when I want to use Ruby in the terminal I need to activate it using chruby.
Hopefully there aren't too many more technical problems with using Jekyll and Ruby for this research blog.
I will see what I can do to tweak the website and ensure that it displays correctly through GitHub.

This afternoon I plan to spend some more time on the Python and Numpy-based script for demonstrating constructive algorithms I developed for my PhD.
I did get word back from The University of Adelaide that since my research is a student project that does not depend on other university IP or have a collaborating company I am able to license the code however I want.
At the moment I'm leaning towards sharing the code from my research with an MIT license.
