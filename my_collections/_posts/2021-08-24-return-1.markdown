I'm coming back to this website to try to restart some of my own learning and research.
My specific focuses have changed slightly. I'm interested in:

1. Constructive and selective neural network algorithms as a path towards online continuous learning.
2. Non-traditional open-access methods for communicating research.
3. Techniques for learning and study.

The constructive and selective neural network algorithms requires fundamental investigation.
I will put effort into simple mathematical and technical developments to understand how neuron construction and selection can be performed and theoretical advantages.

If I am going to spend effort on reviewing literature, I want to work towards an approach to teasing apart the content and refactoring it into a more valuable reference.
I'm going to experiment with the structure of webpages with hperlinks to do this. 
This will be related to (2) non-traditional methods for communicating research and (3) techniques for learning and study.
