This morning an Arduino-based servo-motor controller (BotBoarduino) has arrived that I am going to use to control and program motions for some LynxMotion robot arms.
This project is a part of a modern art project that I'm providing assistance with.
I'll spend some time today setting up this Arduino-based controller board and downloading the necessary software to program it.
The board is designed to control these robot arm servo-motors, so I'm hopeful that it will be a straightforward task to get commands to the servo-motors working.

My other project for today is the interactive Python simulation code for demonstrating a constructive algorithm.
I've been reproducing the original simulation conditions that the constructive algorithm was applied.
These conditions are a shorter duration reproduction of the STDP simulations performed be Masquelier et al. (Competitive STDP-based spike pattern learning, 2009).
Once the STDP simulation is complete and tested I will add the constructive algorithm.
